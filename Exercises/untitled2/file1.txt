ile_name: The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.

access_mode: The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., 
read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. 
This is optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).

buffering: If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. 
If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, 
then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, 
the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).
